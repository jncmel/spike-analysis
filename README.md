# Subretinal Polymer Repository 

Repository for the results of the spike sorting and custom scripts used for the analysis post sorting.
The recordings were done with a 60 electrode MEA with 30&mu;m  electrodes and an interelctrode distance of 200&mu;m. Using a MEA-1060-Inv-BC fom Multi Channel Systems.


The spike sorting was done using Spyking-Circus [https://github.com/spyking-circus/spyking-circus]. The link to the relevant recordings to be used with the paramter files si @. 

# Contents of the repository

# Spike_sorting

Contains the .params and deadtimes files needed for checking the sorting using Spyking-Circus for different recordings.



# Results
Contains the spiketimes of the different clusters obtained from spike sorting. 




# Scripts
Custom code used for plotting the raster across trials and firing rate of different clusters from the .hdf5 files of different recordings

Cluster_ids: File containing the cluster_ids taken of different recodings used for the plots.
